- make songrecord record controllers and progchanges that
  occure before the first tic on the current chan

- cleanup/implement {track,chan,filt,sysex,song}info 
  do we need them? isn't it better to give the user
  primitives and to let him/her define his/her own info
  functions? Try to download a random .mid file from the net
  and to work with it in order to see what is really needed.
  Ex:
  	- which channel is used on which track
	- which notes
	- on which measures

- check (one by one) that every function works and
  that the documetation is accurate. Make a release.

- make song{play,record,idle} scan tracks for controllers,
  pitch bends, prog changes etc... so that the output
  will be in the same state as the song were played from the 
  beggining

- implement undo-stack

- make songplay stop after the EV_STOP is received or
  create a songperf or whatever. But we need songplay to
  stop in scripts such as smfplay(1).

- receiving 'EV_STOP' make all notes off; why?
