- make songplay stop after the EV_STOP is received or
  create a songperf or whatever. But we need songplay to
  stop in scripts such as smfplay(1).

- make chanconfev match the dev/chan pair of the channel

- receiving 'EV_STOP' make all notes off; why?

- cleanup/implement {track,chan,filt,sysex,song}info 
  do we need them? isn't it better to give the user
  primitives and to let him/her define his/her own info
  functions ?

- check (one by one) that every function works and
  that the documetation is accurate. Make a release.

- make song{play,record,idle} scan tracks for volume changes.

- implement undo-stack
