- (easy) create a tempo factor for recording, is it necessary ?

- (difficult) add sysex support: create an allocator for real-time recording:
  create a pool of 256-byte chunks that can be allocated from
  mididev_*. Should-we let "raw" events in the track? what about 
  postprocess the rec-track?

- (difficult) when recording, what to do with datas recieved
  before the first EV_TIC? shold we record them on the track,
  at position number 0? (songrecord must be able to record
  a song from an ext. sequencer as-is).
