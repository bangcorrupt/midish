- cleanup {track,chan,filt,sysex,song}info 
  do we need them? isn't it better to give the user
  primitives and to let him/her define his/her own info
  functions ?

- (difficult) implement undo-stack

- (easy) create a tempo factor for recording, is it necessary ?

- (difficult) when recording, what to do with data recieved
  before the first EV_TIC? shold we record them on the track,
  at position number 0? (songrecord must be able to record
  a song from an ext. sequencer as-is).
