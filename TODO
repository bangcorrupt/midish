- fix batch mode:
	errors -> stderr
	print, info etc... -> stdout
	
- change 'play' semantics not to alway use current filter;
  songfilter is only used in setcurtrack or not at all

- check that filtseti{chan,dev} do the righ thing.

- (easy) add 'mute' flag to tracks

- create an evspec_s structure that
  can handle an event specification (note range, 
  controller range etc...). Use it in trackblank,
  trackcopy etc...

- create a tempo factor for recording

- add sysex support: create an allocator for real-time recording
