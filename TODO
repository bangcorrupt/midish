- metronome click length should be tunable (or at least > 0) in order
  to make the metronome usable without drum kits

- tempo change cleanup is not made in this situation:

	measure 0:	tempo 100
	measure 2:	tempo 50

  inserting tempo=50 at measure 1 should clean the tempo change
  at measure 2

- make multi-measure countdown possible; in song_rt_seek(), put

	rew_measure = (rew + tpm - 1) / tpm;
	rew_beat = ((tic % tpm) + tpb - 1) / tpb;
	rew_tic = (tic % tpb);
	measure -= rew_measure;
	beat = (beat + bpm - rew_beat) % bpm;
	tic = (tic + tpb - rew_tic) % tpb;

- input filter will not work if the clock isn't running: don't do trafic
  limiting before start and/or add timeout...

- make song{play,record,idle} scan tracks for controllers,
  pitch bends, prog changes etc... so that the output
  will be in the same state as the song were played from the 
  beggining

- implement undo-stack

- make songplay stop after the EV_STOP is received or
  create a songperf or whatever. But we need songplay to
  stop in scripts such as smfplay(1).

- receiving 'EV_STOP' in slave-mode make all notes off; why?

- add curves in filt.c
