- bug to fix: on the following track,  'trackblank 2 1 0 {}' and 
  'trackcut 1 1 0' do not work:

                track {
                        96
                        bend {0 0} 0 65
                        48
                        bend {0 0} 0 66
                        48
                        bend {0 0} 0 64
                }


- make multi-measure countdown possible; in song_rt_seek(), put

	rew_meas = (rew + tpm - 1) / tpm;
	rew_beat = ((tic % tpm) + tpb - 1) / tpb
	rew_tic  = (tic % tpb)
	meas -= rew_meas
	beat  = (beat + bpm - rew_beat) % bpm;
	tic   = (tic + tpb - rew_tic) % tpb;

- input filter will not work if the clock isn't running: don't do trafic
  limiting before start and/or add timeout...

- make song{play,record,idle} scan tracks for controllers,
  pitch bends, prog changes etc... so that the output
  will be in the same state as the song were played from the 
  beggining

- implement undo-stack

- make songplay stop after the EV_STOP is received or
  create a songperf or whatever. But we need songplay to
  stop in scripts such as smfplay(1).

- receiving 'EV_STOP' in slave-mode make all notes off; why?

- add curves in filt.c
