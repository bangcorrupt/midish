- import new interpreter from 'psh', this will simplify midish and
  remove some ugly constructs like getacc/putacc.

- add sysex import from smf and clean up export to smf

- add 'song_debug' flag and disable play/rec/idle messages

- (difficult) implement undo-stack

- (easy) create a tempo factor for recording, is it necessary ?

- (difficult) when recording, what to do with datas recieved
  before the first EV_TIC? shold we record them on the track,
  at position number 0? (songrecord must be able to record
  a song from an ext. sequencer as-is).
