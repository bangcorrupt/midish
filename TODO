- make songplay stop after the EV_STOP is received or
  create a songperf or whatever. But we need songplay to
  stop in scripts such as smfplay(1).

- make chanconfev match the dev/chan pair of the channel
  (and update midishrc and docs)

- receiving 'EV_STOP' make all notes off; why?

- cleanup/implement {track,chan,filt,sysex,song}info 
  do we need them? isn't it better to give the user
  primitives and to let him/her define his/her own info
  functions? Try to download a random .mid file from the net
  and to work with it in order to see what is really needed.
  Of corse we need:
  	- which channel is used on which track
	- which notes
	- on which measures

- check (one by one) that every function works and
  that the documetation is accurate. Make a release.

- make song{play,record,idle} scan tracks for volume changes.

- implement undo-stack
