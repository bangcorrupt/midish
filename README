Midish is an open-source MIDI sequencer/filter for Unix-like operating 
systems (tested on OpenBSD and Linux). Implemented as a simple command-line 
interpreter (like a shell) it's intended to be lightweight, fast and 
reliable for real-time performance.

Important features:

	- multiple MIDI devices handling
	- synchronisation to external midi devices
	- real-time MIDI filtering/routing (controller 
	  mapping, keyboard splitting, ...)
	- track recording, metronome
	- basic track editing (insert, copy, delete, ...)
	- track quantisation
	- import and export of standard MIDI files
	- tempo and time-signature changes
