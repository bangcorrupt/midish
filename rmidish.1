.Sh NAME
.Nm rmidish
.Nd front-end to 
.Xr midish 1 ,
using the 
.Xr readline 3
library
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rmidish
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm 
utility is a very simple front-end to 
.Xr midish 1
that uses the 
.Xr readline 3
library.
It runs
.Xr midish 1
in the background, issues an interactive prompt and
passes user commands to
.Xr midish 1 .
The initial purpose of 
.Nm
was to illustrate how to use the
.Fl v
option of 
.Xr midish 1
to create a front-end, but it can be run instead of 
.Xr midish 1
to make the later more user-friendly when used interactively.
.\".Pp
.\"The options are as follows:
.\".Bl -tag -width "-x filename"
.\".It Fl x Ar filename
.\"Path to the
.\".Xr midish 1
.\"binary

environnement variable)
