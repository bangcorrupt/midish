an existing midi file. To stop performance, send an interrupt signal to
.Nm
(for instance by pressing control ^C on the terminal).
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-i devname "
.It Fl a
Append mode. Play the given midi file and append to it a new
track containing recorded events.
.It Fl m
Use metronome.
.It Fl x
Synchronise to the default

Send midi timing information to the default device.
Useful if it is a slave MIDI sequencer.
.It Fl g Ar measure
Start playback and recording at the given measure number.
.It Fl d Ar filename

device. Voice events (notes, controllers, etc) received on the input device
will be recorded and sent as-is to the default device.
Without this flag, the default device will be used for input.
