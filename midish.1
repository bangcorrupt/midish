.Nd MIDI sequencer and filter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm midish
.Op Fl bv
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Midish is a MIDI sequencer/filter implemented as an interactive
command-line interpreter
(users wanting to use midish interactively may consider using the
.Xr rmidish 1
utility). 
Here are some of its features:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Multiple MIDI devices handling
.It
Synchronisation to external MIDI devices
.It
Filtering/routing (controller mapping, keyboard splitting, ...)
.It
Track recording, editing, quatisation
.It
Import and export of standard MIDI files
.It
Tempo and time-signature changes, user configurable metronome
.It
System exclusive messages handling
.El
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-b "
.It Fl b
Do not process 
.Pa "$HOME/.midishrc" 
or
.Pa "/etc/midishrc"
and stop on the first error on the standard input. Useful for scripting
.It Fl v
Print additionnal info before each line of input, useful to
front-ends and for dubugging.
.El
.Pp
Once midish started, the interpreter 
processes the 
.Pa "$HOME/.midishrc" 
file (or
.Pa "/etc/midishrc"
if the later dosn't exist)
and starts prompting for commands.
Certain commands (such as playback, recording) are
blocking, they can be resumed by sending an interrupt signal to 
.Nm
(SIGINT or ^C on ttys).
For further information about the syntax of 
.Nm
refer the 
.Dq Midish user's manual .
